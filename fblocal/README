   This program localizes the Hartree-Fock canonical orbitals according
   to the Boys criteria (see comments in the code for references). 
   The program was written as a utility program to ACES II program system.
   Since the boys localization requries SCF canonical orbitals and
   dipole integrals, your ZMAT file should have "PROPS=FIRST_ORDER" key
   word and the localization program should execute right after the SCF 
   program. Localization should be carried with no symmetry.
   Most other excisting localization programs accept the symmetry 
   runs, but actual loclization is done with no symmetry. Current 
   version is not capable of that since there is bug in transformation
   from symmetry adapted orbitals to pure atomic orbitals. 
   Current version does not localizes the virtual orbitals since 
   original boys localization is not meant to localize virtual
   orbitals (see Coffey Int. J. Quant. Chem. VIII, 777, 1974)
