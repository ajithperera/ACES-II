C THIS CODE IS A HACKED UP VERSION OF A ROUTINE WITH THE SAME
C NAME WHICH WORKED ONLY ON 64 BIT MACHINES.  ITS PURPOSE IS
C TO TAKE A MOL FILE LABEL (IA) AND PUTS INTEGER N INTO THE
C THIRD POSITION (THE # SIGN).  ON THE CRAY, IT APPENDED "N"
C TO THE FOUR-BYTE HOLLERITH STRING, BUT WE CAN'T DO THAT IN
C THE REAL WORLD.

      SUBROUTINE PUTLN(IA,N)
c SG 8/25/98
c This code is now changed to work with IA being character*4
      CHARACTER*4 IA, TEMP
      INTEGER N
      WRITE (TEMP, '(A2, I1, A1)') IA(1:2), N, IA(4:4)
      IA = TEMP
      RETURN
      END
