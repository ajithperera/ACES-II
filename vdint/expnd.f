      SUBROUTINE EXPND(MIN,MOUT,NSIZ)
C
C THIS ROUTINE EXPANDS A MATRIX WHICH IS STORED IN PACKED TRIANGULAR
C  FORM (I<J OR I.LE.J) TO FULL STORAGE MODE.  IF IDIAG IS SET TO 'Y',
C  THE DIAGONAL IS INCLUDED, IF IT IS SET TO 'N' THEN IT IS NOT.
C  IF IANSYM IS SET TO 'Y', THEN THE MATRIX IS ANTISYMMETRIC, IF 'N',
C  THEN IT IS SIMPLY SYMMETRIC.
