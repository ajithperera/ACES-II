 - removed machsp2 common block and converted /cache/cachdir to /cache/cachrec,
   the exact physical record index of the data in each cache slot
 - removed //icore requirement for caching I/O by inserting /cache/icache anchor
 - renamed getlst_fetch and putlst_dump to getlst_io and putlst_io
 - cleaned up ??tlst_io a little
OKAY

 - added aces_fin call before stopping in lambda and anti when they determine
   the calculation is unnecessary
 - added assertion in aces_list_touch that quikget is not set
 - added iprcrl to filspc.com for looking up iprcwd*idaccm
 - changed acescore/aces_io_fin to putrec MOIO stats only if modified
 - changed joda/figio measuring scheme (32-128 cachelines in multiples of 512B)
 - increased maximum number of cache slots to 128
 - added "JASTATUS" record in aces_ja_init and aces_ja_fin to check for clean
   unmount/closure
OKAY <- TDHF does not call aces_fin before stopping in some places

 - destroyed /icdacc/idaccr
 - removed redundant aces_com_* calls in main programs
OKAY

 - took icrsiz out of iopos.com and appended to istart.com (the rest of /iopos/
   was redundant, so the structure was destroyed)
 - split global filspc.com into /buflen/ilnbuf (only used by intprc) and
   /filspc/iprcln,iprcwd (only used by acescore)
 - changed ilnbuf from 1800 to 1536 (3x512)
OKAY

 - converted /istart/IO (i-oh) to /istart/i0 (i-zero) in fno/fno, lambda/vlamcc,
   and dens/vdens
OKAY

OKAY

 - replaced vdint/reduce call to dcopy with call to c_memmove
FIXES: [most] <- xmrcc still a tad screwy

 - added overlap checking and trapping in tools/icopy and tools/dcopy (dcopy is
   wrapped with "#ifdef _DEBUG" so compiling standard source will not pre-empt
   vendor-supplied BLAS)
BREAKS: [lots]

 - created large 1-D char arrays for reading/writing 2-D char arrays into the
   job archive with (get|put)crec (most involving FULLSTGP and COMPSTGP)
   (Fortran has hidden integers that define the length of character arrays.
    Passing the first address of an array of strings confuses the LEN intrisic
    to return the length of the first element and not the length of the entire
    argument.)
OKAY

 - converted all references to 'call (get|put)rec.*ptgp' to (get|put)crec
BREAKS: [everything]

 - wrapped 'call sumsym2' in vee/dt1int2a and vee/dt1int2b with dimension check
   (don't call if there are no elements to increment)

 - WARNING: aces_auxcache_flush does not zero the quikget array like bckdsk
OKAY

 - converted kill routines to aces_io_remove
 - converted kill-like commands in dens/resetscf to aces_io_remove
OKAY

 - removed redundant vdint/updmoi
 - converted libr/opnfil to acescore/aces_io_open
OKAY

 - removed flags and flags2 common blocks from vdint/twoint, vcceh/genrhflst,
   vcceh/genrspnsden, and vcceh/exciteproj
 - fixed dimensions of /flags2/iflags2 in vscf/qrhfit2
 - fixed dimensions of /symloc/isymoff in squint/u2xgix
 - converted libr/gnsyof to acescore/aces_com_symloc

 - WARNING: get rid of (or move) boolean controls from crapsi
OKAY

 - dereferenced isytyp for lists 4?? vee/maklst
FIXES: 35, 54, 57, 63, 64, 65

 - added isytyp assertions to dtran/inipck4, libr2/newtyp2, vea/updlsts2,
   lambda/newtyp2, vcceh/inipck, vcceh/inipck3, and vcceh/newtyp2
BREAKS: 35, 54, 57, 63, 64, 65

 - truncated record names in getrec and putrec to 8 chars
FIXES: [a lot]

 - dumpja('I') -> aces_ja_init
 - dumpja('O') -> aces_ja_fin
 - zeroja      -> aces_ja_truncate
 - jasmry      -> aces_ja_summary
 - getrec, putrec, gfname in libr to acescore
 - errex wraps aces_exit
BREAKS: [a lot]

 - added isytyp assertions to (libr) sstlst, idsymsz, and isymsz
OKAY

 - dereferenced isytyp for lists 40, 41, and 42 in vee/maklst
