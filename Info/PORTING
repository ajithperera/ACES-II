This file contains the optimization restrictions 
on routines in ACES II member executables. 

-----------------
SGI/IRIX/6.5

libr   -  tql2.f (Optimizations will hang the scf
                  code. This is common to most other
                  SGI platforms)

Joda   - gtflgs.f  

vcc5t  - trpint.f

vscf   - evcao2.f 

mrcc   - platforms)

Joda   - gtflgs.f  

vcc5t  - trpint.f 

mrcc.src/mbdirect - hqr.F and hqr2.F  (both are similar
                    tql2.f from old ALOGOL)
                  - fndmine.F and fndnear.F
SGI/IRIX/6.5/64BIT 

vscf   - vscf.f 

vcc    - vcc.f 


lb     - dorgtr.f, dsyr2k.f, dsytrd.f need to be compiled
         with -O1 option. Unless you do that joda, vscf 
         and dens hangs. Strongly recommended to compile
         the whole source tree at level -O1 optimization. 

-----------------
DEC Alpha/OSF1/V4.0

libr2   - w5ring.f (This has effect on vcc and lambda)

libr    - aces_malloc.F (unless you do this things can 
          go wrong in vscf)

ks.src/libra3   - a3getmem.F 
mrcc.src/mrcca3 - a3getmem.F

vcc5t   - trpint.f (-g at the link stage is needed)
 
joda    - gtflgs.f (May have been fixed after recent clean ups)

-----------------
Sparc Ultra-Enterprise/SUNOS/SunOS 5.7

joda   -  gtflags.f (May have been fixed after recent clean ups)

inproc -  dgmoi.f and dgmoid.f 


-------------------
IBM RS6000,power3,power2/

dcopy/scopy - 64-bit POWER3 optimization clobbers data when the src and dest
              vectors overlap. Either compile these two without optimization
              or unrestrict tools/dcopy to use c_memmove all the time.
              This affects tests 47a, 47b and 88 with incorrect frequencies.

-------------------
PC/LINUX/FreeBSD/RedHat

No known optimization problems.
