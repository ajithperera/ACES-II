Comments: In running optimizations and tracking states in mrcc it is
often a good idea to switch NOREORI=ON, as it keeps the orientation of
the molecule fixed. The following job runs as it is supposed to, but
if you do NOT include the NOREORI keyword the program optimizes a completely
different state.

In this case the meaning of the symmetry blocks is not changed (as may happen in
other situations), but the tracking algorithm monitors the AO basis set, and
this depends on orientation (px, py, pz)

Please note that we start from the wrong geometry (one long and two short
bonds), while this is reversed in the final optimized geometry. This is the
origin of the reorientation as the moment of inertia changes acordingly, and
this defines the definition of the axis (if noreori is not set). In such cases
it is good to check symmetry once you run vibrations after the optimization, as
NOREORI orientation depends on the starting geometry.
