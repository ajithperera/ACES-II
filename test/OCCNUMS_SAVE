EMPTY/REMOVE (To remove electrons; electrons are removed from beta)
EMPTY/ADD    (To add electrons; electrons are added to Alpha)

Above two set of numbers tells the program how many occupation
entries to be read for each irrep. They appear like occupation
numbers (and the are if no elecrons are removed or added or 
fractional occupations are requested).

30   16   16   7    30   16   16   7 

This is the total number of functions in each irrep. A trial scf
calculation will print this info to the output. It is recommended that
a standard SCF calculation is done prior to prepare the OCCNUM
file.

These are occupation numbers for Alpha and beta (seperated by a blank line).
RHF cases, beta block is not needed (ignored). 

There is no blank line to seperate occupations of irreps.
