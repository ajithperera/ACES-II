Create AOBASMOS file to be copied to OLDAOMOS for
use as an initial guess in a subsequent H2O
calculation. This will give a simple way to
use a vectors from a previous calcualtions to
be used in a subsequent calcualtions. This option
does not need a GUESS file. Not that with this
option occupation or the number of electrons must
remain uncahnged. This is usefull in following
potential energy surfaces.
