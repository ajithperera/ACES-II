Comments
This would be a way to easily generate the UHF-CCSD[T] surface.
Regular UHF calculations would not break the symmetry of the alpha-beta orbs.
Following the instability generates the desired UHF solution.
The integrals will be transformed twice. Once without dropmo to find the
instability. The second time for the correlated calculation.
